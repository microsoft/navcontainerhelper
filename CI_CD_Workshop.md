# CI/CD Workshop

The recommended way of doing CI/CD today for AppSource apps or PTEs is to use [AL-Go for GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/AL-Go/blob/main/README.md). The documentation will take you through how to do things.

You can access the "old" CI/CD Workshop [here](https://github.com/microsoft/AL-Go/blob/main/Scenarios/old/CI_CD_Workshop.md).
